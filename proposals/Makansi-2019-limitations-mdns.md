## What is the topic?

Improvements to mixed density networks used to predict distributions over future states in images

## Why is the topic of the paper interesting to the group?

Mixed density nets can model multi modal distributions, and predict a variance

## Why is this exact paper/medium the best for this topic?

Possible that the [original 1994 paper (Bishop)](https://publications.aston.ac.uk/id/eprint/373/1/NCRG_94_004.pdf) that introduced MDNs is a better start.

## How much preparation time is needed? (If it is >1h, provide an idea of how to tackle it [skimming, over multiple meetups, preparing a presentation, etc.])

Unsure - depends on the student.  

## Provide a frictionless way to access the medium (provide APA citation, DOI, link or similar).
