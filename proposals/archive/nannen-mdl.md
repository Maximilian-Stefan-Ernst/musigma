This paper describes an interesting and to me very apealing perspective on model selection. To me model selection lies at the heart of good modelling, both in science and industrie. I think it is therfore of greatest interest to our group to extend the theoretical foundations of model selection. This paper is understandable and covers a wide range of historical aproaches, with a good balance between providing details and a big overview.
