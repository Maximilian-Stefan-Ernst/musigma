# Proposals

### [More Causal Inference with Graphical Models in R Package pcalg (Kalisch, M., Mächler, M., Colombo, D., Hauser, A., Maathuis, M. H., & Bühlmann, P., 2014)](https://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/CRAN/web/packages/pcalg/vignettes/pcalgDoc.pdf)

In this package, some Causal Search Algorithms are implemented. They give a short introduction on the Methodology, and then discuss the different algorithms in more detail.
I would propose reading the first 2 paragraphs (12 pages) for the first meeting, which is the methodological introduction.
Then, if we want to dive in further, we could read the rest for the next meeting and try it practically.

### [Understanding Deep Learning Requires Rethinking Generalization (Zhang Bengio Hardt Recht Vinyals, 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03530.pdf)

This paper is a follow up upon th MDL-Principle paper because it extens our discussion of complexity of models but moves beyond any classical models onto deep neural networks. They end with „In this work we presented a simple experimental framework for defining and understanding a notion of effective capacity of machine learning models.“ It is mainly authored by Google but the style is not to tecnical instead it is concise and easy to digest. It won the best paper award at ICLR 2017.

### [A Visual Exploration of Gaussian Processes (Görtler, Kehlbeck, Deussen, 2019)](https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/)

Gaussian processes are essential as a tool in modelling. Deepening the understanding may prove to be extraordinarily usefull beyond their application in regression. Distill is a journal that is famous for their didactive style. This paper allows interactive exploration and experimentation, which makes it ideal for a first introduction.
