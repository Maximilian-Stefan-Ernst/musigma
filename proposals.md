### [Understanding Deep Learning Requires Rethinking Generalization (Zhang Bengio Hardt Recht Vinyals, 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03530.pdf)

This paper is a follow up upon the MDL-Principle paper because it extends our discussion of the complexity of models but moves beyond any classical models onto deep neural networks. They end with „In this work we presented a simple experimental framework for defining and understanding a notion of effective capacity of machine learning models.“ Google mainly authors it, but the style is not too technical; instead, it is concise and easy to digest. It won the best paper award at ICLR 2017.

### [A Visual Exploration of Gaussian Processes (Görtler, Kehlbeck, Deussen, 2019)](https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/)

Gaussian processes are essential as a tool in modelling. Deepening the understanding may prove to be extraordinarily usefull beyond their application in regression. Distill is a journal that is famous for their didactive style. This paper allows interactive exploration and experimentation, which makes it ideal for a first introduction.
